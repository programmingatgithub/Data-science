# Data Science Projects in R

This repository showcases comprehensive Data Science experiments and analyses implemented using the R programming language. The projects encompass data preprocessing, statistical analysis, regression modeling, classification techniques, and insightful visualizations using a variety of real-world datasets.

## Overview of Projects

- **Data Handling and Visualization**  
  Exploration and processing of diverse datasets such as wine quality and iris flower data. Includes data distribution analysis using boxplots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts. Outlier detection is performed through graphical methods for cleaner data understanding.

- **Statistical Analysis and Correlation**  
  Calculation of correlation matrices and visualization through heatmaps to examine relationships among numerical features. Includes application of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate significant differences among categorical groups.

- **Regression Modeling**  
  Application of multiple linear regression to model relationships between dependent and independent variables. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, residual standard error, and error estimates like RMSE and MAE. Discussions on detecting overfitting or underfitting based on these criteria are included.

- **Classification Techniques and Evaluation**  
  Implementation of various classification algorithms including Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines on datasets like iris. Model evaluations utilize accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Visualizations of decision boundaries help illuminate classifier behavior and decision logic.

- **Sampling and Model Validation**  
  Use of sampling techniques to partition datasets into training and testing subsets, enabling robust model validation. Includes logistic regression applications and interpretation guided by information-theoretic metrics such as entropy and information gain to assess feature relevance.

## Technologies and Packages Used

- Core R and Tidyverse packages including `ggplot2` for visualization  
- Modeling packages such as `caret`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `FSelector` for machine learning and feature selection  
- Data handling and splitting facilitated by `caTools` and base R utilities  
- Visual statistical representations with `pheatmap` and enhanced plot customizations  

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Ensure all dependent packages are installed; package installation commands are included within individual scripts for convenience.  
3. Update file paths in scripts to reflect dataset locations on your system.  
4. Run the scripts sequentially or as required to reproduce analyses and visualizations.  
5. Explore, customize, and expand the code to deepen your understanding or adapt to other datasets.
